The original dataset
====================

The original dataset refers to a series of experiments carried out by the University of Genova with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each volunteer had a smartphone on his waist and the goal of the study was finding an univocal correlation between the accelerations measured by smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope and the activities performed by the volunteers. 
The experiments were video-recorded and the data were manually labeled choosing between six alternatives: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' from the originanl dataset for more details. 



run_analysis.R
===============

run_analysis.R starts checking if the needed packages are already installed. If not, it automatically downloads and installs them.

Then it downloads and reads all the data in separate tables. Data from test and train sets are binded togheter using rbind() and cbind(), then the variables are renamed with colnames().  Using merge(){dplyr}, it updates the "Activity" column. Using select(){dplyr}, it subsets the database, extracting the columns which contains the words "Mean" or "mean" and "std" or "Std". Then, using the function gsub(), it modifies the variables' names, making them easier to understand. The result is a tidy data set, as requested.

Then it performs a multivariable grouping (by activity and then by subject ID) and, using summarize_each(), it computes the mean value of each columns. The result is saved in the working directory as a .txt file. It is included in this repo.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.


List of variables
=================

Here are listed the variables we considered in our project:

ID: identifies the volunteer, ranged from 1 to 30.

Activity: indentifies the activity performed. 
It might have one of the following values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

Notes about the variables 
=========================

All time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signal using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals.
The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing the variables listed in frequency domain. 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern.
